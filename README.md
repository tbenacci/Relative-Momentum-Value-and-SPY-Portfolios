This .Rmd file examines 252-day U.S. stock momentum relative to 252-day SPY momentum factor and a relative book-to-market factor. After calculating these and filtering the universe to be the top 500 stocks by market cap close the day of the signal, 1-week portfolios are created and compared. I was inspired to look at relative momentum portfolios more closely after observing how well the factor did as a predictive characteristic for 1-week returns in a random forest classification system. I wondered if I could avoid the large data pipeline and hyperparameter tuning overhead and get by with a simpler approach.
